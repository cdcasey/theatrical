## Project Description
Theatre rehearsals are notoriously difficult to schedule. Actors typically submit black-out dates on paper, email, or via google forms. Regardless of the method, theatre directors need to manually collate the information in order to schedule rehearsals. TheatriCAL puts all of the information necessary to schedule rehearsals in one place. Scheduling rehearsals has never been easier.

## Who uses it?
Anyone trying to organize or be involved in a community theatre production.

## What outputs do they need?
A finalized rehearsal schedule that can be sent out to all members of a production.

## What inputs are needed to generate those outputs?
Information about plays, productions, and actors, specifically black out dates.

## What technologies do you plan to use?
